# Stacks

## Introduction

When you're building a lego tower you have to build up one piece at a time. To get the highest tower, you're going to have to stack lego brick after lego brick on top of each other. The same thing can be thought of with Stacks in programming. You start with one lego brick. That's the first item in the stack. When you add a lego brick on top you're "pushing" a new piece like using the push operation to add an item to the a stack in python it adds to the back or on top of the stack. When we remove an item by using the pop function we remove the last item. That can result in data in the front not being used for quite some time.
