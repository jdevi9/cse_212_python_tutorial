# Trees

## Introduction
Binary Trees is a type of data structure like a linked list or even a stack. It's a structure that holds data. A big difference for this for every node the most children nodes that will be underneath is two.

Python doesn't have a tree system built into it. There are plenty of extensions for Python that you can download to make it a lot easier. A popular one you can install via pip is "binarytree". However, we're going to build a class that will act as a Binary Tree.

## Creation

What determines where values go in a tree are the values. You start at the root, then the next number if it's bigger than the root you add it to the right, then if smaller, add it to the left. You most certainly want to add the values in a random order. That way your tree becomes balanced. With things spread out if you need to traverse to add or find something, it will have a big O notation of O(log n). 

If you added everything in order. Then you would end up with a straight line. See below

This is considered unbalanced and has a big O notation of O(n). Thus kind of defeating the purpose of having a tree in the first place. 

Let's start creating our Binary search tree (BST)
